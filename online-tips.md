# Ready Learner One: Tips and Tricks for Learning in the LMU Oasis
Welcome to the wild and woolly world of learning things exclusively via online resources! At this point we‚Äôve had some time to gird ourselves for the experience, but now we will be in this mode for much longer and new challenges may emerge because of that.

## Take Care of Yourself and Your Vicinity First
Let‚Äôs not forget that we are in this situation due to larger and greater concerns happening outside, so certainly attend to those as they arise and coordinate with me as needed if they affect your course work. LMU also has many health and wellness resources available to support you, collated here: https://studentaffairs.lmu.edu/lionwellness.

## A Word from Your University
LMU has set up a [Student Online Learning Hub](https://academics.lmu.edu/onlinelearning) so be sure to check that out in case there‚Äôs something there for you. There is also a site with resources to [Keep Learning](https://its.lmu.edu/whatwedo/computingsoftware/keeplearning).

## Maintain Multiple Lines of Communication
The lack of physical presence means that your _online_ presence equates to your presence overall. As such, at any given time please make sure that you have multiple mechanisms for making your presence known. For myself personally, there are ways to reach me via:
- email
- Slack
- Discord
- Brightspace discussion forum
- Microsoft Teams

Feel free to leave a note on any of them at any time. I am most likely to be _active_ on them during ‚Äúoffice hours,‚Äù a term we now use in an online rather than physical sense, but please don‚Äôt let that stop you from chiming in whenever it works for you, especially since many of us will be on different time zones as well.

Please consult the Brightspace **Content > Overview** page for your course to get more specific links/information on these venues. Course syllabi will have my office hours.

It‚Äôs my obligation to be on all of them‚Äî_you_ don‚Äôt have to be on all of them yourself, but the expectation is that you are available (and responsive) on at least one of these channels. I try to be in all the places where students might be (online), but students need to _be_ somewhere in the first place in order for this to work.

## Learning Online is Useful Outside of a Pandemic
Some perspective: learning how to learn in this manner will serve you well way beyond the immediate moment. You‚Äôll find that learning in this way will be quite useful, as new knowledge areas and technologies emerge and the only resources about them may be available solely online at first. Thus, if you get the hang of it now, you are picking up a skill that you will find handy for a _long_ time to come.

## Areas of Adjustment
In addition to [maintaining multiple lines of communication](#maintain-multiple-lines-of-communication) (essentially the online rule to rule them all), here are a few more factors to consider when fully online.

### Synchronous Class Sessions
I will hold classes at our scheduled times via Zoom. But again, _see the [what was said earlier](#take-care-of-yourself-and-your-vicinity-first) about taking care of yourself first_. I will record all Zoom sessions and post them to Brightspace. I won‚Äôt have much time to clean up or refine these videos so they‚Äôll be quite raw (and thus best kept private üòÇ)‚Äîhope that will be OK. As mentioned, please visit the **Content > Overview** section of our Brightspace course page for Zoom links and content.

See [the last section of this document](#maximize-live-session-success-by-learning-how-to-control-your-feed) for some tips on getting the most out of this medium.

### Interactions with Classmates
If one thing _really_ changes in an online format, it is our interpersonal interactions. Listening to a professor talk at you or show you stuff on a screen isn‚Äôt too different, and neither is putting your nose to the grindstone to get üí© done on your own.

What shifts significantly‚Äîand in many ways what we (including professors) miss the most in this new normal‚Äîis how we interact with others in our class. As such, perhaps the biggest change in my course(s) with you will be intentionally increased opportunities to work with your classmates, live but online. To maximize success with these encounters, please keep the following in mind:
* Maintain reliable communication with your current (or past) collaborators‚Äîthe [multi-channel approach](#maintain-multiple-lines-of-communication) I mentioned above will help among your classmates as well
* Try to be as flexible as possible with each other when scheduling things‚Äîthere may be some give one way or the other, and although that might take some work, the hope is that the resulting interactions will be worth it (this is particularly relevant for working with folks in different time zones, as addressed in [the next section](#time-zone-differences))
* Don‚Äôt hesitate to approach me if you encounter any challenges or issues with working in a group

### Time Zone Differences
For students who live in different time zones, connecting to the synchronous sessions and pre-scheduled office hours may become infeasible (unless you are truly a night denizen and can now live by your true body clock üåíüåîüåïüåñüåò).

If you are in this situation, note that the live sessions will be recorded and posted to Brightspace, so feel free to view those whenever the time is right for you. For office hours and other direct interactions, start with the following:
- email
- Slack
- Discord
- Brightspace discussion forum
- Microsoft Teams

As mentioned, specific links for those can be found in the **Content > Overview** area for your course on Brightspace.

As also mentioned, these are all ‚Äúavailable‚Äù 24/7 although my response time may vary. But the key is this: these channels are ultimately stepping stones to setting up sessions for synchronous interaction, whether via Zoom, Slack, Discord, or Teams. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask, and we‚Äôll see what we can work out.

I‚Äôll seek to stay cognizant of time zone differences but I may tend to still speak in Pacific time by default, so please bear that in mind if I state a date and time without being specific about time zone.

This really can‚Äôt be stated enough: [Monitor and be responsive to multiple communication channels](#maintain-multiple-lines-of-communication). We will adjust as needed as long as we can communicate.

## Online Presence Tips
OK, so now we come to some slightly more general tips regarding life online. Some are practical, some are philosophical‚Äîall are based on things I‚Äôve seen and experienced personally, so although they won‚Äôt all be absolutely true for everyone, they are indeed based on my own lived online reality (is that an oxymoron?) so far.

### We‚Äôll need to be flexible and go with the flow‚Äîand always keep tabs on alternate communications channels
Stuff will glitch. Stuff will cut off. Stuff might crash. It‚Äôs all OK. When we‚Äôre online, it is understood that these things can happen. What helps us manage this?
* _Keep tabs on multiple means of communication whenever possible:_ ([there it is again!](#maintain-multiple-lines-of-communication)) If video stops working, there can still be audio. If audio breaks, there‚Äôs possibly chat. If the entire video app crashes, you can look at Slack, Discord, Teams, or email (as applicable to you). If all else fails, you can leave voicemail (fortunately, I can check that from home). Redundancy fosters resilience in this scenario.
* _Watch your email more closely than you usually do:_ Speaking of multiple means of communication, email is perhaps the bedrock of all online means of communication. It‚Äôs mature; it‚Äôs ubiquitous. Make sure that you have easy access to university email as much as possible.
* _Your ultimate backup is a mobile phone with Internet:_ In the event of a _huge_ glitch (ISP cuts you off, power goes down, etc.), chances are that a mobile phone will still work. Don‚Äôt try to get back on Zoom (unless your phone is super-amazing with a ‚ö°Ô∏è fast connection)‚Äîbut leave a message on one of the venues listed multiple times already so that I know not to worry.

<small>_(and if we encounter a glitch that‚Äôs so catastrophic that even mobile phones can‚Äôt communicate‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶we probably have bigger problems than staying connected in class)_</small>

If any glitches happen to _me_, I will seek to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, so the first thing to do is hang tight. If I experience protracted issues, I‚Äôll seek to follow the same flow above in order to keep you posted. If this happens during a synchronous class session and I somehow can‚Äôt recover quickly enough, we‚Äôll find ways to make up for it.

### Online resources are finite, and these days, everyone is using them
All computing resources are finite. Bandwidth is perhaps the prime resource that we‚Äôll be consuming online. There are times when there won‚Äôt be enough of it or we will lose it outright.

Class and office hour video sessions consume a lot of resources and may get glitchy or go down. You can try again as needed but don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt reconnect; we‚Äôll figure it out (again see: [multiple means of communication](#maintain-multiple-lines-of-communication)).

### Maximize live session success by learning how to control your feed
We want to approximate that in-person feeling as much as possible, but we also know (as already stated) that there are resource and medium limitations to this. Overall, the approach I recommend is this:

> Max everything out first, then ‚Äúdegrade gracefully‚Äù depending on available resources.

In a more structured way, I recommend this flow:
1. Keep video active
2. Keep audio active‚Äîunless you have notable ambient noise
3. If bandwidth/resources can‚Äôt maintain #1 and #2, start by deactivating video, then audio‚Ä¶
4. ‚Ä¶and try to make use of other features‚Äîreactions, hand raising, chat‚Äîto maintain a presence during a synchronous class session.
5. If things are just overly shaky or janky, just disconnect and leave me a note so we can catch you up

A few other notions:
- Practice doing quick toggles of your video and audio‚Äîthis will minimize disruption during synchronous sessions
- But of course, don‚Äôt forget to unmute yourself when you want to talk
- _Audio will have a slight delay_ (as those of you who have tried to do live singalongs over Zoom may attest)‚Äîgive people time to respond, perhaps speak a little more slowly, and pause a little more between sentences
    * If two or more people accidentally start talking at the same time, volunteer to give the other people ‚Äúfirst dibs‚Äù at speaking right after
    * Be ready to help arbitrate who spoke first in case people keep speaking on top of each other
    * I may also pause for potentially awkward lengths of time, to accommodate delays when people try to talk‚Ä¶this will be normal, so don‚Äôt worry if I do this (unless it turns out that I actually lost my connection‚Äîin which case, follow the earlier protocol)
- _And here‚Äôs something we can‚Äôt do in person as easily:_ You can share your screen when permitted! With permission from me, you can take over or annotate the screen so you can demonstrate where you‚Äôre stuck firsthand. Get to know how to use the sharing and annotation tools in order to avail of this capability.

OK, I think that‚Äôs everything (so far). Do keep the link to this document handy in case I add or change something. Even with this document, we‚Äôll practice what we preached above about being flexible and going with the flow.
