# Ready Learner One: Tips and Tricks for Learning in the LMU Oasis
Welcome to the wild and woolly world of learning things exclusively via online resources! At this point we‚Äôve had some time to gird ourselves for the experience, but now we will be in this mode for much longer and new challenges may emerge because of that.

## Take Care of Yourself and Your Vicinity First
Let‚Äôs not forget that we are in this situation due to larger and greater concerns happening outside, so certainly attend to those as they arise and coordinate with me as needed if they affect your course work. LMU also has many health and wellness resources available to support you, collated here: https://studentaffairs.lmu.edu/lionwellness.

## A Word from Your University
LMU has set up a [Student Online Learning Hub](https://academics.lmu.edu/onlinelearning) so be sure to check that out in case there‚Äôs something there for you.

## Maintain Multiple Lines of Communication
The lack of physical presence means that your _online_ presence equates to your presence overall. As such, at any given time please make sure that you have multiple mechanisms for making your presence known. For myself personally, there are ways to reach me via:
- email
- Slack
- Discord
- Brightspace
- Microsoft Teams

Feel free to leave a note on any of them at any time. I am most likely to be _active_ on them during ‚Äúoffice hours,‚Äù a term we now use in an online rather than physical sense, but please don‚Äôt let that stop you from chiming in whenever it works for you, especially since many of us will be on different time zones as well.

Please consult the Brightspace Content Overview page for your course to get more specific links/information on these venues. Course syllabi will have my office hours.

It‚Äôs my obligation to be on all of them‚Äî_you_ don‚Äôt have to be on all of them yourself, but the expectation is that you are available (and responsive) on at least one of these channels. I try to be in all the places where students might be (online), but students need to _be_ somewhere in the first place in order for this to work.

## Learning Online is Useful Outside of a Pandemic
Some perspective: learning how to learn in this manner will serve you well way beyond the immediate moment. When you fully launch into a career in computing, you‚Äôll find that learning in this way will be quite useful, as new technologies emerge and the only resources about these technologies will be available solely online at first. Thus, if you get the hang of it now, you are picking up a skill that you will find handy for a _long_ time to come.

## Things That Don‚Äôt Change
Many aspects of the way that I already teach computer science courses will not change. So if you‚Äôre used to them, then great. If you aren‚Äôt, then this is a good time to check them out:
* I will continue to post screen recordings of class sessions as private YouTube videos
* Links to these videos will continue to be accumulated in Brightspace (under _Content > Screengrab Videos_)
* I will continue to be available via email or Slack for any questions or other interactions
* Assignments will continue to be submitted via GitHub Classroom
* Feedback will continue to be committed to the GitHub repository of the corresponding assignment
* Grades will continue to be entered in Brightspace

## Things That Are Different
OK, so now here are the adjustments that we‚Äôre making to get fully online.

### Classes
I will continue to hold classes at our scheduled times via Zoom. But again, _see the first section about taking care of yourself first_. I will record those Zoom sessions just as I always have, so if you are more comfortable with watching the screengrabs later, then that is perfectly OK.

For all classes and other Zoom-related activities, we will use the Zoom link listed in the Overview section of your respective Brightspace course pages.

Just go there in order to ‚Äúattend class.‚Äù See [the last section of this document](#maximize-live-session-success-by-learning-how-to-control-your-feed) for some tips on getting the most out of this medium.

For our first class online, I plan to get everyone acquainted with the environment and field questions on this temporary new normal.

#### Time Zone Differences
For students who will be living in different time zones, connecting to the live sessions and office hours may become infeasible (unless you are truly a night denizen and can now live by your true body clock üåíüåîüåïüåñüåò).

If you are in this situation, note that the live sessions will continue to be recorded and posted to YouTube, so feel free to view those whenever the time is right for you. For office hours and other direct interactions, the following options are available:

* Individual appointments for an online session
* Email
* Slack

With all of the stuff going on, I may tend to still use Pacific time by default, so please bear that in mind if I state a date and time without being specific about time zone.

### Office Hours
I will continue to be available at my pre-scheduled office hours. The only change is that, instead of physically going to my office, you would just go to office hours Zoom link listed in the Overview section of your respective Brightspace course pages.

Further, I will remain reachable (as before) via email (dondi@lmu.edu) or Slack (@dondi in the [Slack LMUCS workspace](https://lmucs.slack.com)).

#### Office Hours for Students in a Different Time Zone
As mentioned above, the regularly-scheduled office hour times might not work for students who are living in a different time zone. In those situations, please avail of the three possibilities listed above. Baseline rule: Maintain open, multiple communication channels. We will adjust as needed.

### Slack Channels
Due to the anticipated increased use of Slack while we are fully online, I have created specific channels for our courses. This will help with putting related messages and threads together more easily. Do go to those channels and monitor them actively while we are in 100% online mode: [#cmsi284](https://lmucs.slack.com/archives/CV6PX0RBP) and [#cmsi355](https://lmucs.slack.com/archives/CV8KCB2HM), respectively.

## Online Presence Tips
OK, so now we come to some slightly more general tips regarding life online. Some are practical, some are philosophical‚Äîall are based on things I‚Äôve seen and experienced personally, so although they won‚Äôt all be absolutely true for everyone, they are indeed based on my own lived online reality (is that an oxymoron?) so far.

### We‚Äôll need to be flexible and go with the flow
Stuff will glitch. Stuff will cut off. Stuff might crash. It‚Äôs all OK. When we‚Äôre online, it is understood that these things can happen. What helps us manage this?
* _Keep tabs on multiple means of communication whenever possible:_ If video stops working, there can still be audio. If audio breaks, there‚Äôs possibly chat. If the entire video app crashes, you can look at Slack and email. If all else fails, you can leave voicemail. Redundancy fosters resilience in this scenario.
* _Watch your email closely than you usually do:_ Speaking of multiple means of communication, email is perhaps the bedrock of all online means of communication. It‚Äôs mature; it‚Äôs ubiquitous. Make sure that you have easy access to university email as much as possible.

### Online resources are finite, and these days, everyone will be using them
All computing resources are finite (except for those in the theory of computation). Bandwidth is perhaps the prime resource that we‚Äôll be consuming online. There are times when there won‚Äôt be enough of it or we will lose it outright.

Class and office hour video sessions consume a lot of resources and may get glitchy or go down. You can try again as needed but don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt reconnect; we‚Äôll figure it out (see: multiple means of communication above).

As long as I am able to do so, I will continue to record things so that if you can‚Äôt attend synchronously, you can watch things later. The only thing you lose is that live, interactive element‚Äîwhich can be made up for during \[virtual\] office hours or via Slack. So bottom line: no worries, we‚Äôll work something out.

### Maximize live session success by learning how to control your feed
* It‚Äôs nice to see everyone‚Äôs faces while conducting a live session, but not at the cost of someone‚Äôs discomfort or insufficient bandwidth, so be cognizant of those factors and situate yourself as you see fit. I won‚Äôt mind either way.
* In any case, do get familiar (and proficient) with the start/stop video button: You may want to turn the camera on when you talk, or you may want to have it on by default unless your connection gets shaky. Knowing how to toggle video with ease will be helpful here.
* Depending on how many people are on live at the same time, ambient noise may build up or get distracting. To minimize this, also learn how to control your outgoing audio. The _Mute_ button is particularly useful. But don‚Äôt forget to unmute yourself either when you want to talk.
* Again on the theme of multiple means of communication, find and use the Zoom chat panel‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep it open myself. You can type messages in here at any time. I might also switch to this if audio or video start to glitch.
* Even with today‚Äôs high bandwidth, audio will have a slight delay‚Äîgive people time to respond, perhaps speak a little more slowly, and pause a little more between sentences.
* _Here‚Äôs something we can‚Äôt do in class easily:_ You can share your screen when needed! When asking a question, you have the option to take over the screen so you can demonstrate where you‚Äôre stuck firsthand. Get to know how to use the Share button in order to avail of this capability.

OK, I think that‚Äôs everything (so far). Do keep the link to this document handy in case I add or change something. Even with this document, we‚Äôll practice what we preached above about being flexible and going with the flow.
